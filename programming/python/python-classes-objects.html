<h1>Python OOPs(Classes and Objects)</h1>
<p>Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that supports the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. </p>

<h2>Class</h2>
<p>A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of the class can have. A class serves as a blueprint for creating multiple instances (objects) that share the same attributes and behaviors.
</p>

<h2>Object</h2>
<p>An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or thing based on the class definition. Each object has its own state (values of attributes) and can perform actions (methods) defined in the class.
</p>

<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
<p>Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It hides the internal implementation details and provides an interface to interact with the object. Encapsulation helps achieve data abstraction and protects the integrity of data.
</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (superclass). The subclass can extend or modify the inherited attributes and methods, providing code reusability and the ability to create specialized versions of a class.
</p>

<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p>Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables code to work with different types of objects through a common interface. Polymorphism allows methods to be overridden in subclasses, providing different implementations based on the object type.
</p>

<h2>Abstraction</h2>
<p>Abstraction is the process of representing complex real-world entities using simplified models. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through classes, where you define the essential characteristics and behaviors of objects without getting into the low-level implementation details.
</p>

<h2>Method Overriding</h2>
<p>Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method.
</p>

<h2>Method Overloading</h2>
<p>Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. In Python, method overloading is achieved by using default parameter values and optional arguments.
