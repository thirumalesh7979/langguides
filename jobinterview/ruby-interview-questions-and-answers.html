<h2 id="1">1. Explain the concept of metaprogramming in Ruby and provide an example.
</h2>
<p>Metaprogramming in Ruby refers to the ability to write code that can create or modify code dynamically at runtime. It allows you to write programs that can generate or manipulate other programs. </p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
class Person
attr_accessor :name, :age
end

person = Person.new
person.name = "Ram"
person.age = 25

# Dynamically defining a new method
Person.class_eval do
define_method :greet do
     puts "Hello, my name is #{name} and I am #{age} years old."
end
end

person.greet
# Output: Hello, my name is Ram and I am 25 years old.

</code></pre>


<h2 id="2">2.  How does Ruby handle inheritance and multiple inheritance?
</h2>
<p>Ruby supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one superclass. When a class inherits from another class, it can access the methods and attributes defined in the superclass. Inheritance in Ruby is implemented using the &lt; symbol.</p>
<pre><code class="langauge-py">
class Animal
     def speak
          puts "I am an animal."
     end
     end

class Cat &lt; Animal
end

cat = Cat.new
cat.speak
# Output: I am an animal.
   
</code></pre>


<h2 id="3">3.  Describe the difference between a module and a class in Ruby.
</h2>
<p>In Ruby, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure, behavior, and state of the objects. Classes are used to create multiple instances (objects) with similar characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="4">4.  What are Ruby gems and how do you use them in your projects?
</h2>
<p>RubyGems is a package manager for Ruby libraries and applications. Gems are pre-packaged libraries or modules that you can easily add to your Ruby projects. They are typically hosted on the RubyGems.org repository. Gems provide reusable code and extend the functionality of your Ruby applications.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
# Installing the 'json' gem
gem install json

# Requiring and using the 'json' gem
require 'json'

data = '{"name": "John", "age": 25}'
json_hash = JSON.parse(data)
puts json_hash["name"]
# Output: John
     
</code></pre>


<h2 id="5">5.  Explain the concept of mixins in Ruby and their benefits.
</h2>
<p>Mixins in Ruby allow you to share behavior between classes without using multiple inheritance. A mixin is a module that defines a set of methods that can be included in other classes. By including a mixin, a class can inherit and use the methods defined in the mixin module.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
module Greeting
     def say_hello
          puts "Hello!"
     end
end

class Person
     include Greeting
end

person = Person.new
person.say_hello
# Output: Hello!
</code></pre>





<h2 id="6">6. How does Ruby handle method visibility? Describe the different visibility levels.
</h2>
<p>Public methods can be called from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
</p>
<p>Protected methods can be called only within the defining class and its subclasses. They are typically used to provide internal functionality to the class hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Private methods can be called only within the defining class. They cannot be accessed by subclasses or from outside the class. Private methods are often used for internal implementation details that should not be exposed.
</p>



<h2 id="7">7.  What are Ruby blocks, procs, and lambdas? How do they differ from each other?
</h2>
<p>Blocks are chunks of code that can be passed to methods. They are typically enclosed within curly braces {} or do...end. Blocks are not objects themselves but can be converted into Proc objects.
</p>
<p>Procs (short for procedures) are objects that encapsulate blocks of code. They can be created using the Proc.new method or the -> (stabby lambda) syntax. Procs can be assigned to variables and passed around as objects.
</p>
<p>Lambdas are similar to Procs, but with some differences in behavior. Lambdas are objects of the Proc class but have strict argument checking and return behavior. They are defined using the lambda keyword or the -> syntax.
</p>

<h2 id="8">8.  Describe the purpose and usage of Ruby's enumerable module.
</h2>
<p>The Enumerable module in Ruby provides a set of methods that can be used with any collection-like object, including arrays, hashes, and custom collections. It adds powerful iteration and enumeration capabilities to these objects.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
class MyCollection
     include Enumerable

     def each
     # implementation of iterator
     end
end

collection = MyCollection.new
collection.each { |item| puts item }

collection.map { |item| item * 2 }
collection.select { |item| item > 5 }
   
</code></pre>


<h2 id="9">9. How do you handle file I/O operations in Ruby? Explain the use of File class and related methods.
</h2>
<p>Ruby provides the File class and related methods for handling file input/output operations. The File class allows you to open, read, write, and manipulate files.
</p>
<p>To open a file, you can use the File.open method with a block. Within the block, you can perform operations like reading, writing, and closing the file. The File class provides various methods for reading and writing data, such as read, write, puts, gets, etc.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
# Reading from a file
File.open('example.txt', 'r') do |file|
     puts file.read
end

# Writing to a file
File.open('example.txt', 'w') do |file|
     file.write("Hello, World!")
end
     
</code></pre>



<h2 id="10">10.  What is the purpose of the "yield" keyword in Ruby and how is it used?
</h2>
<p>The yield keyword in Ruby is used within a method to invoke a block that is passed to the method. It allows you to pass control and arguments from the method to the block.
</p>
<p>When a method encounters the yield keyword, it pauses execution and transfers control to the block. The block executes, and when it finishes, control returns to the method to continue execution.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
def greet
     puts "Hello,"
     yield("Ram") if block_given?
     puts "Nice to meet you!"
end

greet { |name| puts "My name is #{name}." }
# Output:
# Hello,
# My name is Ram.
# Nice to meet you!
   
</code></pre>




<h2 id="11">11.  Explain the concept of closures in Ruby and their practical applications.
</h2>
<p>Closures are a combination of a function and the binding of variables within its scope. In Ruby, closures are created when a function references variables from its surrounding scope, even when that function is executed outside of that scope.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
def make_counter
count = 0

return lambda do
     count += 1
     puts count
end
end

counter = make_counter
counter.call
# Output: 1
counter.call
# Output: 2
   
</code></pre>


<h2 id="12">12.  How does Ruby handle concurrency and threading? Explain the use of threads and synchronization.
</h2>
<p>Ruby supports concurrency and threading through the Thread class. Threads allow you to execute multiple units of code simultaneously, potentially improving performance and responsiveness in certain scenarios.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
thread1 = Thread.new do
10.times do |i|
     puts "Thread 1: #{i}"
     sleep 0.1
end
end

thread2 = Thread.new do
10.times do |i|
     puts "Thread 2: #{i}"
     sleep 0.1
end
end

thread1.join
thread2.join
   
</code></pre>



<h2 id="13">13.  Describe the concept of operator overloading in Ruby and provide an example.
</h2>
<p>Operator overloading allows you to redefine the behavior of built-in operators, such as <strong>+, -, *,</strong> etc., for objects of your custom classes. By overloading operators, you can specify how objects of your class should behave when used with these operators.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
class Vector
attr_accessor :x, :y

def initialize(x, y)
     @x = x
     @y = y
end

def +(other)
     Vector.new(@x + other.x, @y + other.y)
end
end

vector1 = Vector.new(2, 3)
vector2 = Vector.new(4, 5)
result = vector1 + vector2
puts result.x, result.y
# Output:
# 6
# 8
   
</code></pre>



<h2 id="14">14.  How does Ruby handle regular expressions? Explain the use of the Regexp class and related methods.
</h2>
<p>Ruby provides regular expression support through the Regexp class and related methods. Regular expressions are patterns used to match and manipulate strings based on specific rules.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
string = "Hello, Ruby!"

if /Ruby/ =~ string
     puts "Match found!"
else
     puts "No match found."
end
# Output: Match found!
</code></pre>




<h2 id="15">15.  What are Ruby's built-in data structures? Explain the usage of arrays, hashes, and sets.
</h2>
<p><strong>Arrays:</strong> Arrays are ordered collections of objects. They can contain any type of object and can dynamically resize. Arrays support indexing, appending, removing elements, and many useful methods for manipulation and iteration.
</p>
<p><strong>Hashes:</strong> Hashes are key-value pairs, also known as associative arrays or dictionaries. They provide a way to store and retrieve values based on unique keys. Hashes are unordered and allow fast lookup and insertion.
</p>
<p><strong>Sets:</strong> Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful for tasks that involve checking membership or removing duplicates. Sets automatically enforce uniqueness and provide set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
# Array
array = [1, 2, 3]
array.push(4)
array.each { |item| puts item }

# Hash
hash = { name: "John", age: 25 }
hash[:name]
hash.each { |key, value| puts "#{key}: #{value}" }

# Set
require 'set'
set = Set.new([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])
set.add(4)
set.each { |item| puts item } 
</code></pre>

     
 

<h3 id="16">16. Describe the purpose and usage of Ruby's standard library 'date' and 'time' modules.
</h3>
<p>Ruby provides the 'date' and 'time' modules as part of its standard library for working with dates, times, and time zones.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
require 'date'
require 'time'

current_date = Date.today
puts current_date

current_time = Time.now
puts current_time
</code></pre>





<h3 id="17">17. How does Ruby handle memory management and garbage collection?
</h3>
<p>Ruby utilizes automatic memory management and garbage collection. It has a built-in garbage collector responsible for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.
</p>





<h3 id="18">18. Explain the concept of modules and namespacing in Ruby.
</h3>
<p>Modules in Ruby serve as containers for classes, methods, and constants, providing a way to group related functionality together. Modules promote code organization, reusability, and namespacing.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
module MyModule
def my_method
     puts "This is a method from MyModule."
end
end

class MyClass
include MyModule
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.my_method
# Output: This is a method from MyModule.

</code></pre>


<h3 id="19">19. How do you handle database interactions in Ruby? Explain the use of ActiveRecord or other ORMs.
</h3>
<p>Ruby provides a variety of options for handling database interactions, one popular approach being the use of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries. The most widely used ORM in Ruby is ActiveRecord, which simplifies database operations by abstracting them through Ruby classes and objects.
</p>




<h3 id="20">20. Describe the concept of memoization in Ruby and its benefits.
</h3>
<p>Memoization is a technique used to cache the return value of a method, allowing subsequent calls to the method with the same arguments to be served from the cache instead of recomputing the result. It improves performance by reducing redundant computations.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
require 'memoist'

class Calculator
     extend Memoist

     def expensive_calculation(x)
     puts "Performing expensive calculation..."
     # Perform some time-consuming computation
     sleep 2
     x * x
     end
     memoize :expensive_calculation
end

calculator = Calculator.new
puts calculator.expensive_calculation(5)
puts calculator.expensive_calculation(5)
     
</code></pre>



<h3 id="21">21. How does Ruby handle method missing and dynamic method definitions?
</h3>
<p>Ruby allows you to handle method calls that are not defined or missing through the use of the method_missing method. When Ruby encounters a method call that it cannot find in the object's class hierarchy, it invokes the method_missing method instead of raising an error. This gives you the opportunity to define custom behavior for handling missing methods.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
class MyClass
     def method_missing(method_name, *args)
          puts "You called #{method_name} with arguments #{args.join(', ')}"
     end
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.some_method(1, 2, 3)
# Output: You called some_method with arguments 1, 2, 3
   
</code></pre>



<h3 id="22">22. Explain the purpose and usage of Ruby's exception hierarchy.
</h3>
<p>Ruby has a rich exception hierarchy that allows for catching and handling different types of errors and exceptional conditions. At the top of the hierarchy is the Exception class, from which all other exceptions inherit.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
begin
     # Code that may raise an exception
     raise ArgumentError, 'Invalid argument'
rescue ArgumentError => e
     puts "ArgumentError occurred: #{e.message}"
rescue StandardError => e
     puts "StandardError occurred: #{e.message}"
else
     puts "No exception occurred."
ensure
     puts "Always executed."
end
   
</code></pre>

<h3 id="23">23. How do you handle testing in Ruby? Explain the use of popular testing frameworks like RSpec or MiniTest.
</h3>
<p>Testing is an essential part of software development, and Ruby provides several testing frameworks to facilitate the process. Two popular testing frameworks in Ruby are RSpec and MiniTest.
</p>
<p>RSpec is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing expressive and readable tests. It emphasizes behavior specification and focuses on describing the expected behavior of the code under test using a syntax resembling natural language.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
# spec/my_class_spec.rb
require 'rspec'
require_relative '../my_class'

RSpec.describe MyClass do
     describe '#some_method' do
     it 'returns the sum of two numbers' do
          my_obj = MyClass.new
          result = my_obj.some_method(2, 3)
          expect(result).to eq(5)
     end
     end
end
     
</code></pre>

<h3 id="24">24. Describe the concept of Ruby on Rails and its relationship with the Ruby language.
</h3>
<p>Ruby on Rails, often referred to as Rails, is a popular web application framework written in Ruby. It provides a development environment and a set of conventions to streamline the creation of web applications.
</p>

<h3 id="25">25. How do you handle performance optimization in Ruby? Share some common techniques and best practices.
</h3>
<p>Identifying and improving algorithmic complexity to reduce the time and resources required for operations.
</p>
<p>Caching frequently used or expensive computations using techniques like memoization.
</p>
<p>Utilizing efficient data structures like arrays, hashes, and sets for specific use cases.
</p>
<p>Leveraging built-in Ruby optimizations, such as using immutable strings (''.freeze) or symbols (:symbol) for repeated values.
</p>
<p>Avoiding unnecessary object allocations and garbage collection by reusing objects or using object pooling.
