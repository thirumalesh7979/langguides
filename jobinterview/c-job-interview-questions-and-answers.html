<h2 id="1">1.  What is the difference between the ++i and i++ operators in C?
</h2>
<p>The ++i operator is known as the pre-increment operator. When used, it increments the value of the variable by 1 and then returns the incremented value. </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int i = 5;
int result = ++i;  // result will be 6, i will be 6
</code></pre>
<p>The i++ operator is known as the post-increment operator. When used, it increments the value of the variable by 1, but it returns the original value before the increment. </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int i = 5;
int result = i++;  // result will be 5, i will be 6
</code></pre>

<h2 id="2">2.  Explain the concept of function pointers in C.
</h2>
<p>Function pointers in C are variables that store the memory address of a function. They allow you to treat functions as data and pass them as arguments to other functions or assign them to variables.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int (*ptr)(int, int);
</code></pre>
<p>You can assign a function's address to a function pointer using the function's name without parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int add(int a, int b) {
     return a + b;
}

ptr = add;  // Assigning the address of add() function to ptr

</code></pre>
<p>To call the function using the function pointer, you can use the dereference operator (*)</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int result = (*ptr)(3, 4);  // Calling the add() function using ptr
</code></pre>

<h2 id="3">3.  How does C handle pass-by-reference using pointers?
</h2>
<p>C doesn't have native pass-by-reference like some other programming languages, but you can achieve similar behavior using pointers.</p>
<p>When you pass a variable's address (using the '&' operator) as an argument to a function, you can modify the variable directly within the function using the pointer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
void increment(int *num) {
     (*num)++;  // Increment the value pointed to by num
}

int main() {
     int value = 5;
     increment(&value);  // Pass the address of value to increment()
     printf("%d\n", value);  // Output: 6
     return 0;
}     
</code></pre>




<h2 id="4">4. What are the different storage classes in C? Explain their uses.
</h2>
<p>C provides several storage classes to define the scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables.</p>
<p><strong>auto:</strong> This is the default storage class for local variables. It is automatically assigned by the compiler and exists within the block where it is defined.</p>
<p><strong>register:</strong> This storage class suggests the compiler to store the variable in a register for faster access. </p>
<p><strong>static:</strong> A variable declared with the 'static' storage class retains its value between function calls.</p>
<p><strong>extern:</strong> The 'extern' storage class is used to declare a variable that is defined in another file.</p>
<p><strong>typedef:</strong> The 'typedef' keyword is used to create a new name (alias) for an existing data type.</p>
<p><strong>static (for functions):</strong> The 'static' storage class can also be used with functions. When a function is declared as 'static', its visibility is limited to the current translation unit.</p>


<h2 id="5">5. How does C handle dynamic memory allocation using the calloc() and realloc() functions?
</h2>
<p>The calloc() function is used to dynamically allocate memory for multiple elements of a specified size. It initializes the allocated memory to zero. The function takes two arguments: the number of elements to allocate and the size of each element. </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int *numbers = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));  // Allocate memory for 5 integers
if (numbers != NULL) {
     // Use the allocated memory
     numbers[0] = 10;
     numbers[1] = 20;
     // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>The realloc() function is used to resize dynamically allocated memory. It takes two arguments: a pointer to the previously allocated memory and the new size to allocate. It returns a pointer to the resized memory block or NULL if the reallocation fails. The original contents of the memory block are preserved up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. </p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int *numbers = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));  // Allocate memory for 5 integers
// ...
numbers = (int *)realloc(numbers, 10 * sizeof(int));  // Resize memory to accommodate 10 integers
if (numbers != NULL) {
     // Use the resized memory
     // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="6">6.  What is the difference between the "const" and "volatile" keywords in C?
</h2>
<p>"const" is used to declare a variable as constant, meaning its value cannot be changed once assigned.
</p>
<p>"volatile" is used to indicate that a variable's value can be modified by external entities that are not part of the regular program flow, such as hardware interrupts or concurrent threads.
</p>


<h2 id="7">7.  Explain the purpose of the "sizeof" operator in C.
</h2>
<p>The "sizeof" operator is used to determine the size, in bytes, of a data type, variable, or expression. It is often used to allocate memory dynamically, ensure proper alignment, or perform operations on arrays.
</p>


<h2 id="8">8.  How do you handle errors and exceptions in C programming?
</h2>
<p>C does not have built-in exception handling mechanisms like other high-level languages. Error handling is typically done through return values, error codes, or special sentinel values to indicate errors. Additionally, C supports the use of "setjmp" and "longjmp" functions to perform non-local jumps for error handling purposes.
</p>


<h2 id="9">9.  What is the difference between the "strcpy" and "strncpy" functions in C?
</h2>
<p>"strcpy" is used to copy a null-terminated string from the source to the destination. It continues copying until it encounters a null character, potentially causing buffer overflows if the destination is not large enough to hold the source string.
</p>
<p>"strncpy" is used to copy a specified number of characters from the source to the destination. It guarantees that the destination will be null-padded if the source string is shorter than the specified length. However, if the source string is longer, it will not be null-terminated in the destination, which may lead to unexpected results.
</p>


<h2 id="10">10.  How does C support multi-dimensional arrays?
</h2>
<p>C supports multi-dimensional arrays, which are essentially arrays of arrays. They can be declared with multiple pairs of square brackets, such as int arr[3][4] to create a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns. Elements in a multi-dimensional array can be accessed using multiple indices, e.g., arr[1][2] refers to the element in the second row and third column.
</p>


<h2 id="11">11.  Explain the concept of recursion in C. Provide an example.
</h2>
<p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It involves two components: the base case(s), which specifies the termination condition, and the recursive case(s), which define how the function calls itself with smaller inputs. Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems that can be naturally divided into smaller instances.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&lt;

int factorial(int n) {
     if (n == 0)  // Base case
          return 1;
     else
          return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Recursive case
}

int main() {
     int num = 5;
     int result = factorial(num);
     printf("%d! = %d", num, result);
     return 0;
}
          
</code></pre>

<h2 id="12">12.  What is the difference between a macro and a function in C?
</h2>
<p>A macro in C is a preprocessor directive that defines a pattern and its replacement. It is a text substitution mechanism performed before the compilation stage. Macros are typically used for simple, repetitive tasks and are not type-safe. They can be error-prone if used incorrectly but offer greater flexibility and performance.
</p>
<p>A function in C is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined with a return type, name, and parameter list. They are type-checked and compiled separately, allowing for modular and reusable code. Functions are generally safer and more structured compared to macros.
</p>

<h2 id="13">13.  Describe the usage and benefits of the "typedef" keyword in C.
</h2>
<p>The "typedef" keyword in C is used to create an alias or a new name for existing data types. It allows programmers to define custom names for complex data types, making the code more readable and easier to maintain. By using "typedef," you can create a shorthand notation for data types, enhancing code clarity and reducing repetition.
</p>

<h2 id="14">14.  How do you handle command-line arguments in C?
</h2>
<p>Command-line arguments can be passed to a C program when it is executed. The "main" function can take two parameters: "argc" (argument count) and "argv" (argument vector). "argc" represents the number of command-line arguments, while "argv" is an array of strings containing the actual arguments. By accessing the elements of "argv," you can retrieve and process the command-line arguments within your C program.
</p>

<h2 id="15">15.  Explain the concept of bit manipulation in C.
</h2>
<p>Bit manipulation involves manipulating individual bits within binary representations of data. It allows you to perform operations at a low level, such as setting, clearing, toggling, or checking the state of specific bits. Bit manipulation in C is often used to optimize code, compactly store flags or options, perform bitwise operations, or interact with hardware-level data.
</p>



     
 

<h3 id="16">16. What are the different types of file access modes in C?
</h3>
<p>"r": Opens a file for reading. The file must exist.
</p>
<p>"w": Opens a file for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it is created. If it does exist, its contents are truncated.
</p>
<p>"a": Opens a file for appending. If the file doesn't exist, it is created. If it does exist, new data is appended to the end.
</p>

<h3 id="17">17. How does C handle structures and unions? What are their differences?
</h3>
<p>Structures (structs) in C allow you to group different data types together as a single entity. Members of a structure can have different data types and are accessed using the dot operator (.).
</p>
<p>Unions in C are similar to structures but can hold only one member at a time. All members share the same memory location, allowing different interpretations of the same memory area. Unions are useful when you need to store multiple types of data in the same memory space.
</p>

<h3 id="18">18. Describe the process of reading and writing binary files in C.
</h3>
<p>To read from a binary file, you can use the "fread" function to read a specific number of bytes into a buffer. You need to specify the size of each element to read, the number of elements, the file pointer, and the buffer where the data will be stored.
</p>
<p>To write to a binary file, you can use the "fwrite" function to write a block of data from a buffer into the file. Similar to "fread," you specify the size of each element, the number of elements, the file pointer, and the buffer containing the data to be written.
</p>

<h3 id="19">19. Explain the role of the "static" keyword in C.
</h3>
<p>When used inside a function, it creates a variable that retains its value between function calls. It is useful for preserving data across multiple function invocations.
</p>
<p>When used with a global variable or function, it restricts the scope of the variable or function to the current file, making it inaccessible from other files.
</p>
<p>When used with a local variable, it extends the lifetime of the variable to the duration of the program, rather than being destroyed after leaving its scope.
</p>

<h3 id="20">20. What is the purpose of the "enum" keyword in C?
</h3>
<p>The "enum" keyword in C is used to define an enumeration, which is a user-defined data type consisting of a set of named constants, called enumerators. Enumerations provide a way to define meaningful names for a group of related values, making the code more readable and self-explanatory. Enums are often used to represent a set of discrete options or states.
</p>


<h3 id="21">21. How does C handle memory deallocation using the free() function?
</h3>
<p>C provides the dynamic memory allocation functions malloc(), calloc(), and realloc() to allocate memory dynamically. After you have finished using the dynamically allocated memory, you must deallocate it to avoid memory leaks. The free() function is used to release the memory previously allocated by these functions. You pass the pointer to the memory block you want to deallocate to the free() function. Once freed, the memory becomes available for reuse by other parts of the program.
</p>
 


<h3 id="22">22. Explain the difference between the "break" and "continue" statements in C.
</h3>
<p>The "break" statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. When encountered, it terminates the loop or exits the switch statement, transferring control to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.
</p>
<p>The "continue" statement allows you to bypass the rest of the code within a loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.
</p>

<h3 id="23">23. Describe the concept of preprocessor directives in C.
</h3>
<p>Preprocessor directives in C are commands interpreted by the preprocessor, which is a separate phase of the compilation process. They start with a '#' character and provide instructions to modify the source code before the actual compilation begins. Preprocessor directives can be used to include header files, define constants using #define, perform conditional compilation with #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, #endif, and more. These directives allow for customization and configuration of the source code during the preprocessing stage.
</p>


<h3 id="24">24. How do you implement a linked list in C?
</h3>
<p>A linked list is a data structure in which elements, known as nodes, are connected using pointers. Each node contains data and a pointer to the other next node. In C, a linked list can be implemented using a struct to define the node structure. The struct contains the data and a pointer to the next node. Operations like inserting, deleting, and traversing the linked list are performed by manipulating the pointers.
</p>


<h3 id="25">25. How does C handle file I/O operations? Explain the functions fopen(), fread(), and fwrite().
</h3>
<p>fopen(): This C function is used to open a file. It takes a filename and a mode parameter as arguments and returns a file pointer. The mode parameter specifies the purpose of opening the file, such as "r" for reading, "w" for writing, "a" for appending, and more.
</p>
<p>fread(): This C function is used to read data from a file. It takes parameters like the pointer to a buffer where the data will be stored, the size of each element to read, the number of elements to read, and the file pointer. It returns the number of elements successfully read.
</p>
<p>fwrite(): This C function is used to write data to a file. It takes parameters like the pointer to the data to be written, the size of each element to write, the number of elements to write, and the file pointer. It returns the number of elements successfully written.</p>
